Product design is a complex task. Designers need to consider user, technology trend, aesthetic theme and so on. In addition, designer needs to make prediction and consider what the product would like in the future.

This project use simple python code to prompt multimodal Large Language Model (Gemini 1.5 pro) to provide reference for designing future product. First, the model is trained with transfer learning technique on old product images to get the productâ€™s development trend throughout years. Then the platform would make the first prediction. After that a latest product image is used to improve the predicted product. Last, the output text is prompt to image generation.

The project uses mobile phone as an example to ask Creation Future to design a future mobile phone. The images used are in phone_image_exmples.zip.

CreateFuturev4.md file gives detailed prompts and output from Gemini. 
CreateFuturev4.py is the code to run the project.
